Omnibus
********

An Omnibus is defined as a volume containing several novels or other items previously published separately and that is exactly what the InQuest Omnibus project intends to be for Open Source Intelligence collection, research, and artifact management.

By providing an easy to use interactive command line application, users are able to create sessions to investigate various artifacts such as IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, usernames, file hashes, Bitcoin addresses, and more as we continue to expand.

This project has taken motivation from the greats that came before it such as SpiderFoot, Harpoon, and DataSploit. Much thanks to those great authors for contributing to the world of open source.

The application is written with Python 2.7 in mind and has been successfully tested on OSX and Ubuntu 16.04 environments.

This is a beta of the final application and as such there may be some bugs or other weirdness during usage. For the most part Omnibus is fully functional and can be used to begin OSINT investigation right away.

Contribution
Omnibus is built in a modular manner that allows the easy addition of OSINT data source modules and import/export modules. Each module per category is included in a single directory, and by adding a few lines of code, your module could be the next!

As the Wiki continues to grow, we will have full examples of how to write custom plugins.

If you happen to notice any bugs or other issues, please create an Issue and/or Pull Request. We would also love for community support in creating more modules and expanding the Omnibus use-cases. Forks and Pull Requests for new features are more than welcome!

Documentation
This README file serves as a quick overview of Omnibus and its features. Full documentation is available in the 'docs' folder of this repository.


Vocabulary
**********
Before we begin we'll need to cover some terminology used by Omnibus.

Artifact:
	An item to investigate
	Artificats can be created in two ways:
	Using the new command or by being discoverd through module execution

Session:
	Cache of artifacts created after starting the Omnibus CLI
	Each artifact in a session is given an ID to quickly identify and retrieve the artifact from the cache
	Commands can be executed against an artifact either by providing it's name or it's corresponding session ID

Module:
	Python script that performs some arbitirary OSINT task against an artifact
